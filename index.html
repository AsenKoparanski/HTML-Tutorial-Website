        <h2> What is HTML ?</h2> 
        <hr/>
        <p class="text">HTML(HyperText Markup Language) was created back in 1991 by Tim Berners-Lee as a language for describing web-pages using ordinary text. 
        It is one of the simpler programming languages and can be learned rather quickly because the basics can be obtained in one sitting. HTML also offers a lot of possibilities when it comes to the variety of things you can do with it. It is constantly changing and improving to meet the requirements of the fast growing internet audience. </p>
       <p class="text">
        Originally, HTML was developed with the intent of defining the structure of documents like headings, paragraphs, lists, and so forth to facilitate the sharing of scientific information between researchers. Now, HTML is being widely used to format web pages with the help of different tags available in HTML language. Hypertext refers to the way in which Web pages (HTML documents) are linked together. Thus the links available on a webpage are called Hypertext.
       </p>
        <p class="text">
        There is still confusion when people talk about HTML files but it is actually straightforward. Every web page is a HTML file. These are simple text files that contain code with the HTML tags and are viewed through a browser. The browser reads the files and translates the text into whatever form the user intended. Anyone can write their own code to visualize their ideas simply by using the HTML tags. You can learn more about HTML and tags <a href="html.html">here</a> and try writing HTML code <a href="editor.html">here.</a>

  <h3> HTML History </h3>
  <p class="text"> After its release it went through a number of revisions and recieved some extensions. When the W3C(The World Wide Web Consortium) was created in 1995 they attempted an extension which resulted in HTML 3.0. A more pragmatic approach in HTML 3.2 took its place two years later(1997). HTML 4 followed the same year and a better version 4.01 was released in 1999. The next year W3C released XHTML  1.0 which was different than the previous versions. They stopped evolving HTML and reformulated HTML 4 in XML. It had no new features except the new serizalization and was completed in 2000. At the moment we are using HTML 5 which is an extension to HTML 4.01 and was published in 2014.
